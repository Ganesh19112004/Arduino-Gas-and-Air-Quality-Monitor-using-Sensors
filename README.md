# Arduino-Gas-and-Air-Quality-Monitor-using-Sensors
This Arduino-based Gas and Air Quality Monitor uses gas sensors to detect LPG, smoke, CO, H2, and CH4 levels, while the DHT11 sensor measures temperature and humidity. Data is displayed on an LCD screen, showing gas concentrations, AQI, temperature, and humidity, making it ideal for safety, environmental monitoring, and air quality control.
